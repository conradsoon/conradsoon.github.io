      <h2>about me!</h2>
      <p>
        i'm currently a CS & Math double major at the National University of
        Singapore (NUS)! i recently won a 10k grant from NUS to investigate the
        use of LLMs in improving CS education and i'm currently enrolled in a
        graduate-level reading group for LLMs.
      </p>
      <p>
        you can reach me at conradsoon[at]gmail.com or
        <a href="https://twitter.com/eigen_conrad">@eigen_conrad</a> on twitter!
      </p>

      <h2>experience</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          i was a SWE intern at
          <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/about?lang=en">TikTok</a> - i owned,
          built and designed an alarm monitoring system here!
        </li>
        <li>
          i was a SWE intern at a crypto exchange for a while - i worked on
          optimising trading systems in C++ here!
        </li>
        <li>
          i was a SWE intern at <a href="https://www.tech.gov.sg/">GovTech</a> -
          i built a cool smart lighting system here!
        </li>
        <!-- <li>i enjoy competitive programming sometimes!</li> -->
      </ul>

      <h2>hire me!</h2>
      <p>
        i have a decent math & algorithms background. i'm also somewhat
        proficient with working with lower level languages like C++. i really
        love computational-type or optimisation-type problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        as of right now, i'm really interested in getting experience on any part
        of the LLM pipeline (be it messing with kernels, training your own
        models, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        it's always been my dream to go to the US to work. if you're a startup
        that's willing to sponsor a J-1 for a scrappy young student that's
        curious about everything, please reach out!
      </p>
      <p>
        i'm a singapore citizen with work authorization in singapore. i'm also
        eligible for the
        <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b1">H-1B1</a>
        visa.
      </p>

      <h2>trivia</h2>
      <p>
        i like (computational) math a lot: here's some of the textbooks that
        i've worked through on my own.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Understanding Analysis by Abbott</li>
        <li>Linear Algebra Done Right by Stephen Axler</li>
        <li>Numerical Linear Algebra by Trefethen & Bau (this is a WIP)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>i'm kind of a self-taught competitive programmer.</p>

      <p>
        i have a collection of golang gopher keychains available for sale. if
        you'd like to buy some (i can do bulk orders as well) hit me up on
        carousell!

        i am unfortunately one of those "map-game" lovers. i really like maps, i
        used to spend hours in class doodling entire worlds of fake maps.

      <!-- <p>
        i like drawing, and art in general. i used to design my own stickers to
        sell in school.

      <p>recently i've been obsessed with iain banks' the culture series.</p>
